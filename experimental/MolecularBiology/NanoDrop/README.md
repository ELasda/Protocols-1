## bring: 
- your DNA or RNA sample(s)
- your blank (same liquid that your sample is diluted/eluted with)
- p2 or p10
- own tips (red box)
- marker/paper for recording


## protocol:
1. Clean the pedestal by wiping with wet Kimwipes (nuclease-free H2O)
2. Close sampling arm
3. Open the NanoDrop program on the computer
4. Select Nucleic Acid
5. Select DNA or RNA (sample type dropdown menu on the right) 
6. Pipette 1-2 uL of the blank onto the pedestal
7. Close sampling arm
8. Click “blank”
<br>*(optional) click “measure” to check blank*
9. Dry pedestal with Kimwipe
10. Pipette 1-2 uL of sample onto the pedestal
11. Close sampling arm
<br> *(optional) type in name of sample*
12. Click “measure”
13. Dry pedestal with Kimwipe
14. Repeat with each sample
15. Record results or insert flash drive and export report
16. Clean the pedestal by wiping with wet Kimwipes (nuclease-free H2O)

## notes:
- Pure samples should have an A260/280 ratio of about 1.8 for DNA and about 2.0 for RNA, 
<br> and an A260/230 ratio of at least 1.8 (ideally close to 2.0) 
- DNA and RNA absorb at 260nm, but contaminating phenol in samples absorbs at about 270nm and can affect measurements.

### Common contaminants (ThermoFisher):
Below are several examples of reagents commonly used with nucleic acids that have absorbance in
the 220 – 240 nm range. Note: Phenol also exhibits significant absorbance between 260 – 270 nm
which may shift the peak and result in an overestimation of the nucleic acid concentration.

- Phenol/Trizol extraction—residual reagent contamination may be indicated by abnormal spectra between 220 to 240 nm as well as by shifts in the 260 to 280 nm region. 
- Column extraction—residual guanidine may contribute to a peak near 230 nm and a shift in the trough from 230 nm to ~ 240 nm. 
- Magnetic Beads—residual beads may cause light scatter and result in abnormal spectra. 
- Samples with concentrations approaching the lower limit of 2 ng/uL may result in unacceptable 260/280 and/or 260/230 ratios.
