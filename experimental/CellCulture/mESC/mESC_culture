Culturing mouse ES cells

A. General guidelines for maintaining mouse ES cells
•	Mouse ES cells are maintained at 37°C and 7.5% CO2 in the lower Rinn incubator.
•	Make sure you know whether your ES cells need to be cultured on feeder cells!
        -> Feeder-dependent ES cells need to be cultured on irradiated MEFs as feeders on gelatin and in ES cell medium containing LIF.
        -> Feeder-independent ES cells need to be cultured on gelatin and in ES cell medium containing LIF and 2i (PD0325901 and CHIR99021).
•	Culture medium needs to be changed every day!
•	To remove differentiated cells, ES cells need to be passaged every 2-3 days!
•	Splitting ratio of ES cells depends on their density and is usually between 1:4 and 1:8.
•	Be gentle when pipetting cells and avoid making bubbles!
•	Proper ES cells are growing in dome-shaped colonies that are round with smooth edges and should not get in contact with other colonies.
•	Observe ES cells under the microscope regularly, i.e. in the morning and ideally also in the evening to be able to take the appropriate actions!

B. Coating plates/dishes with gelatin
1.	Add the appropriate amount of 0.1% gelatin (Millipore, ES-006-B) to the plate/dish.
2.	Leave the plate/dish with gelatin solution in the incubator for at least 30 min.
3.	Aspirate the gelatin solution and immediately add cells to the dish.
Note: Do not allow the dishes to dry before adding the cells. 

C. Preparing MEF feeder layers
1.	Thaw irradiated MEFs (ATCC, SCRC-1040.1) onto a gelatinized plate/dish in MEF medium.
2.	1 vial of MEFs is sufficient to cover around 100-120 cm2.
3.	Let MEFs attach in the incubator overnight.
4.	No need to change medium. Use feeder cells within a week.

D. Thawing mouse ES cells and MEFs
1.	Warm appropriate medium in 37°C water bath.
2.	Prepare 15 ml Falcon tube with 10 ml of appropriate medium.
3.	Gently shake cryovial in 37°C water bath until almost completely thawed, allowing time to clean tube before placing in hood. Alternatively, warm up cryovial with your hands inside the hood.
4.	Using a 2-ml pipette or a P1000, transfer the contents of the cryovial to the 15 ml Falcon tube.
5.	Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
6.	Aspirate supernatant with a 2-ml pipette, flick a few times against the tube and gently resuspend the pellet in appropriate medium by pipetting up and down.
7.	Plate.

E. Changing medium
1.	Warm appropriate medium.
2.	Aspirate medium from the plate/dish.
3.	Add medium to the plate/dish.

F. Trypsinizing mouse ES cells
1.	Warm mouse ES cell medium and 0.05% trypsin in 37°C water bath.
2.	Aspirate medium from plate/dish.
3.	Wash plate/dish with PBS.
4.	Add pre-warmed trypsin and place in incubator.
5.	After 1 min, tap the plate/dish to facilitate trypinisation and place back in incubator for an additional min.
6.	Using a P1000, pipette trypsin against the surface to dislodge all cells. 
7.	Neutralize the trypsin by adding 10 volumes of mouse ES cell medium (-2i, -LIF).
8.	Gently pipette trysinized cells against the dish to disaggregate any clumps. Avoid making foam.
9.	Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
10.	Aspirate supernatant with a 2-ml pipette, flick a few times against the tube and gently resuspend the pellet in mouse ES cell medium (+2i, +LIF) by pipetting up and down.
11.	Plate.

G. Freezing mouse ES cells
1.	Collect cells by trypsinization.
2.	Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
3.	Aspirate supernatant with a 2-ml pipette, flick a few times against the tube and gently resuspend the pellet in mouse ES cell freezing medium.
4.	Prepare multiples of 1-ml aliquots in well-labeled cryovials (type of cells, genotype, passage number, number of cells or what plate/dish to thaw the cells onto, your name and date).

H. Adapting feeder-dependent mouse ES cells to 2i conditions
1.	After thawing, maintain ES cells on feeders and ES cell medium containing LIF for at least 2 passages.
2.	Perform a ‘heavy’ split (e.g. 1:2) onto a gelatin-coated plate/dish in ES cell medium containing LIF and 2i.
3.	Let cells in incubator for 1 h to allow MEFs to attach to the surface.
4.	Collect supernatant containing non-attached ES cells and transfer them to a new gelatin-coated plate/dish.
5.	Repeat MEF depletion once more at the next passage to get rid of all MEFs.
