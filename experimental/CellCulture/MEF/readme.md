# Culturing MEFs

### A. General guidelines for maintaining MEFs
- MEFs are maintained at **37°C** and **5% CO<sub>2</sub>** in the upper Rinn incubator.
- Culture **medium** needs to be **changed every second day**.
- MEFs usually need to be **passaged** when **80-90% confluent**.
- Splitting ratio of MEFs is usually **1:4**.
- Be gentle when pipetting cells and avoid making bubbles!

### B. Thawing MEFs
1.	Warm MEF medium in 37°C water bath.
2.	Prepare 15 ml Falcon tube with 10 ml of MEF medium.
3.	Gently shake cryovial in 37°C water bath until almost completely thawed, allowing time to clean tube before placing in hood. Alternatively, warm up cryovial with your hands inside the hood.
4.	Using a 2-ml pipette or a P1000, transfer the contents of the cryovial to the 15 ml Falcon tube.
5.	Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
6.	Aspirate supernatant with a 2-ml pipette, flick a few times against the tube and gently resuspend the pellet in MEF medium by pipetting up and down.
7.	Plate.

### C. Changing medium
1.	Warm MEF medium.
2.	Aspirate medium from the plate/dish.
3.	Add medium to the plate/dish.

### D. Trypsinizing MEFs
1.	Warm MEF medium and 0.05% trypsin in 37°C water bath.
2.	Aspirate medium from plate/dish.
3.	Wash plate/dish with PBS.
4.	Add pre-warmed trypsin and place in incubator.
5.	After 1 min, tap the plate/dish to facilitate trypinisation and place back in incubator for an additional min.
6.	Using a P1000, pipette trypsin against the surface to dislodge all cells. 
7.	Neutralize the trypsin by adding 10 volumes of MEF medium.
8.	Gently pipette trysinized cells against the dish to disaggregate any clumps. Avoid making foam.
9.	Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
10.	Aspirate supernatant with a 2-ml pipette, flick a few times against the tube and gently resuspend the pellet in MEF medium by pipetting up and down.
11.	Plate.

### E. Freezing MEFs
1.	Collect cells by trypsinization.
2.	Centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
3.	Aspirate supernatant with a 2-ml pipette, flick a few times against the tube and gently resuspend the pellet in mouse MEF freezing medium.
4.	Prepare multiples of 1-ml aliquots in well-labeled cryovials (type of cells, genotype, passage number, number of cells or what plate/dish to thaw the cells onto, your name and date).
