## Introduction
Single molecule RNA FISH (smRNA FISH) uses up to 48 20-mer oligonucleotides designed against the RNA of interest, each labeled with a single fluorophore. Oligonucleotides tilling against the transcript will produce a fluorescent signal, while the off target signal (one or two oligonucleotides) is not sufficient to provide a fluorescent signal.

The protocol described here employs commercial buffers available from [LGC Biosearch](https://www.biosearchtech.com/)

#### Reagents:
Probes
- Custom design or purchase pre-designed probe sets at [Stellaris RNA FISH probe designer](https://www.biosearchtech.com/products/rna-fish/custom-stellaris-probe-sets)

Cell fixation and permeabilization
- poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, P1524-25MG)
- TE Buffer (10mM-Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0)
- Formaldehyde (For molecular biology,  Sigma-Aldrich, F8775-4X25ML)
- PBS, RNase-free
- Ethanol (For molecular biology)
- Nuclease-Free H2O

Hybridization
- Stellaris Wash Buffer A (store RT)
- Formamide (deionized,  Thermo Fisher Scientifc, 4440753)
- Stellaris Hybridization Buffer (store 4°C)

Wash and Imaging Preparation
- Stellaris Wash buffer B (store RT)
- Glucose Oxidase (Sigma-Aldrich, G2133-10KU)
- Catalase (MilliporeSigma, 219261-100KU)
- Tris pH 8.0
- 20% Glucose solution (BioUltra, MilliporeSigma, 49163-100ML)
- Sodium Acetate (3M, pH 5.5)
- Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific, H357)
- Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930)

Materials
- Glass coverslips, 18 mm2 round
- Glass slides
- Sharp point forceps

#### Probe dilution and storage
Re-dissolve dried oligonucleotide probe blend in 100 μL of fresh RNase-free TE buffer to create a stock 100 μM. Mix well by pipetting up and down and briefly vortex. Spin down tube briefly. Aliquot and freeze at -20°C.

#### smRNA FISH
1. Coat sterile coverslips with poly-L-lysine (10 μg/mL in PBS) for 5min, vitronectin (human iPS cells) 1h or gelatin (mouse ES cells) 1h. Coating can be prolonged from the minimum time suggested for up to several hours.
2. Seed cells on glass coverslips in full growth media at desired confluency. 
3. At the day of experiment, wash coverslips 2 times with PBS.
4. Fix the cells in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature (RT).
5. Wash 2 times with PBS.
6. Immerse coverslips in 70% EtOH at 4°C for a minimum of 1h. 
7. Prior hybridization, wash coverslips with 2 mL of wash buffer A (LGC Biosearch Technologies) supplemented with 10% deionized formamide (Agilent) at RT for 5 min. 
8. Prepare hybridization buffer: 10% deionized formamide in wash buffer A (LGC Biosearch Technologies) containing 1:100 smRNA FISH probe dilution.
9. Hybridize with 80 μL of hybridization buffer overnight at 37°C in a humid chamber. 
10. The next day, wash cells with 1 mL of wash buffer A with 10% formamide for 30 min at 37°C, 
11. Wash with wash buffer A with 10% formamide containing Hoechst DNA stain (1:1,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30min at 37 °C. 
12. Wash coverslips with 1 mL of wash buffer B (LGC Biosearch Technologies) for 5 min at RT, 
13. Equilibrate 5 min in base glucose buffer (2x SSC, 0.4% glucose solution, 20 mM Tris pH 8.0 in RNase-free H2O)
14. Incubate 5 min in Base Glucose buffer supplemented with 1:100 dilution of glucose oxidase (stock 3.7 mg/mL) and catalase (stock 4 mg/mL). 
15. Mount coverslips on glass slides with ProlongGold or ProlongGlass (Life Technologies).
