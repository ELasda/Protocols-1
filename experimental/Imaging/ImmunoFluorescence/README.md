## Introduction
Indirect immunofluorescence described here uses two antibodies. The primary antibody is unconjugated and a fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibody directed against the primary antibody is used for detection.

#### Reagents:
Primary and secondary antibodies
- take care that the choice of the fluorophore matches the filters of the available microscope. If co-staining with two antibodies is applied, take care the fluorophores are separated enough in the spectra so that there is no bleed-through signal from one channel to the other.

Cell fixation and permeabilization
- poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich, P1524-25MG)
- Formaldehyde (For molecular biology,  Sigma-Aldrich, F8775-4X25ML)
- PBS (molecular biology grade)
- Triton-X (For molecular biology)
- Nuclease-Free H2O

Immunostaining
- BSA (molecular biology grade)
- PBS (molecular biology grade)
- Triton-X (molecular biology grade)

Washing and Imaging Preparation
- PBS (molecular biology grade)
- Triton-X (For molecular biology)
- Hoechst (Thermo Fisher Scientific, H357)
- Prolong Gold (Thermo Fisher Scientific, P36930)

Materials
- Glass coverslips, 18 mm2 round
- Glass slides
- Sharp point forceps

#### Immunofluorescence
All washing steps were performed at RT, if not otherwise noted. 

1. Coverslips were coated with poly-l-lysine (10 μg/ml) for minimum 5min. Note: some cells may not need pre-coating of the coverslips, however, in general, poly-l-lysine enhances cells attachment and ensures they are not washed away during the protocol.
2. Following coating, cells were seeded at desired confluence in full growth media.
3. On the day of immunofluorescence, coverslips were washed 2× with PBS and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10min.
4. Coverslips were washed 2x with PBS.
5. Cells were permeabilized by incubating in PBS-T (0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 15 min. 
6. After permeabilization, cells were washed 2 × 5min in PBS.
5. Subsequently, cells were blocked with 2% BSA in PBS (addition of 0.1% Triton-X is optional and may help with some antibodies -- good to test for each antibody) for 60 min.
6. Add the desired concentration of primary antibody diluted in 0.1% BSA to the cells and incubate for 3 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4°C.
7. Remove primary antibody solution and wash the cells 3x with PBS.
8. Add the desired concentration of fluorescent dye–labeled secondary antibody along with a compatible counterstain for the nucleus (DAPI or Hoechst) diluted in 0.1% BSA (adding Triton-X should be determined empirically) and incubate for 45 min at room temperature protected from light.
9. Wash the cells three times with PBS-T.
10. Perform the last wash in PBS and mount the coverslips with Prolong Gold (Life Technologies) or Prolong Glass (Life Technologies) on glass slides. Leave to curate over night before proceeding to image acquisition.
